# Nonlinear and Mixed-integer optimization

This class will cover computational aspects of **convex and nonlinear optimization**, drawing from motivating examples in operations research and machine learning. Please follow the installation instructions below before the class. The preassignment at the end is a check that everything is installed correctly.

## Install Julia packages

In addition to the installation instructions from the previous session, we will use the following packages:
- LinearAlgebra
- Gadfly
- DelimitedFiles
- Distributions
- PyPlot
- Mosek (see below)

Note: the notebooks used in this session **should** work with Julia version 0.7+.
If you are running Julia version 0.6.4 or earlier, please install an updated version.
