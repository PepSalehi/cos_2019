# Nonlinear and Mixed-integer optimization

This class will cover computational aspects of **convex and nonlinear optimization**, drawing from motivating examples in operations research and machine learning. Please follow the installation instructions below before the class. The preassignment at the end is a check that everything is installed correctly.

## Install Julia packages

In addition to the installation instructions from the previous session, we will use the following packages:
- LinearAlgebra
- Gadfly
- DelimitedFiles
- Distributions
- PyPlot
- Mosek (see below)

# Install Mosek instructions


Install each one by running ``Pkg.add("xxx")`` where ``xxx`` is the package name
from a Julia prompt or notebook.
