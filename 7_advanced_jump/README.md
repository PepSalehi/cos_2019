# Nonlinear and Mixed-integer optimization

This class will cover computational aspects of **convex and nonlinear optimization**, drawing from motivating examples in operations research and machine learning. Please follow the installation instructions below before the class. The preassignment at the end is a check that everything is installed correctly.

## Install Julia packages

In addition to the installation instructions from the previous session, we will use the following packages:
- LinearAlgebra
- Gadfly
- DelimitedFiles
- Distributions
- PyPlot
- Test
- TravelingSalesmanHeuristics (via Pkg.clone("https://github.com/evanfields/TravelingSalesmanHeuristics.jl/"))

Note: the notebooks used in this session **should** work with Julia version 0.7+.
If you are running Julia version 0.6.4 or earlier, please install an updated version.

## Preassignment
No results need to be submitted on Stellar for this pre-assignment. 

If your Gurobi installation was not working correctly in session 6, please fix this before the session starts.

Optional: There are 1-2 moments in the session where I will use solvers not listed in this readme file. If you want to follow along, you can install Mosek (see [here](https://www.mosek.com/), academic licenses free) and CPLEX (see [here](https://ibm.onthehub.com/WebStore/OfferingDetails.aspx?o=733c3d21-0ce1-e711-80fa-000d3af41938&pmv=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000), academic licenses free). However, they take a while to install, so you can also watch the overhead projector for these parts.
