# Data Wrangling and Visualization with R

## Preassignment

## Reproducible Reporting with RMarkdown

[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a framework for easily producing interactive reports, presentations, and dashboards in `R`. 

To prepare RStudio to work with R Markdown, run the following code in your RStudio console. 

```{r}
install.packages(c('knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'flexdashboard'))
```

To test that you have installed these packages successfully, please: 

1. Pull to ensure that you have the latest version of this repository. 
2. Open the file `preassignment.rmd` in RStudio. 
3. Click the "Knit" button at the top of the source editor, or press `cmd + shift + k` (`ctrl + shift + k` on Windows). The "Knit" button is the one circled in [this image](http://cinf401.artifice.cc/images/workflow-25.png).
4. After a few moments, RStudio should pop up with a new window containing a dashboard that looks like [this](https://philchodrow.github.io/mban_orientation/data_science_intro/preassignment/preassignment1.html). If your dashboard matches the example, submit it on Stellar. If not, please email the instructors with the error message you received.
